 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdwp/ThreadReference/Name/name001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdwp]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This test performs checking for
 *         command set: ThreadReference
 *         command: Name
 *     Test checks that debugee accept the command packet and
 *     replies with correct reply packet. Also test checks that
 *     returned name of the tested thread is equal to the expected one.
 *     Test consists of two compoments:
 *         debugger: name001
 *         debuggee: name001a
 *     First, debugger uses nsk.share support classes to launch debuggee
 *     and obtain Transport object, that represents JDWP transport channel.
 *     Also communication channel (IOPipe) is established between
 *     debugger and debuggee to exchange with synchronization signals.
 *     Next, debugger obtains from debuggee classID for tested thread class
 *     and threadID as the value of a class static field.
 *     Then, debugger creates command packet for ThreadReference.Name
 *     command with the found threadID as arguments, writes packet to
 *     the transport channel, and waits for a reply packet.
 *     When reply packet is received, debugger parses the packet structure
 *     and extracts thread name. Also test checks that the name is equal
 *     to the expected one.
 *     Finally, debugger sends debuggee signal to quit, waits for it exits
 *     and exits too with the proper exit code.
